    "### Pros and Cons of the Aggregator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "1. The solution is very straightforward and easy to implement.\n",
    "2. The solution takes into account several criteria, which makes it more or less balanced.\n",
    "3. The categories are based on a customer research!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "1. There are many, many cases not covered by the criteria.\n",
    "2. Luggage and refund are almost never taken into account, but they might be important to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggestion\n",
    "One way the algorithm could be improved is by taking into account all possible combinations of the criteria values, so that it doesn't have to say 'sorry' for not knowing how to categorize a flight :) However, that would make me as a developer invent, build and maintain rules for 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 = 36 possible cases (that's if we are to leave the categories themselves as they are).\n",
    "\n",
    "An easier way would be to assign weights to the criteria. Say a ticket price accounts for 50% of a flight's ranking, the number of transfers - 30%, refund and luggage - 10% each. Then we need to transform values of each criterion into some kind of score keeping in mind that for the price and the number of transfers the scale must be inverted: the cheaper, the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of such a scale for price would be:\n",
    "- <=200 -> 10\n",
    "- 200-210 -> 9\n",
    "- 210-220 -> 8\n",
    "- 220-230 -> 7\n",
    "- 230-240 -> 6\n",
    "- 240-250 -> 5\n",
    "- 250-260 -> 4\n",
    "- 260-270 -> 3\n",
    "- 270-280 -> 2\n",
    "- 280-290 -> 1\n",
    "- \\>=290 -> 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Or ```(300 - max(n, 200)) // 10```\n",
    "\n",
    "...and for transfers:\n",
    "- 0 (a direct flight) -> 10\n",
    "- 1 -> 8\n",
    "- 2 -> 6\n",
    "- 3 -> 4\n",
    "- 4 -> 2\n",
    "- 5+ -> 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Or ```(5 - min(n, 5)) * 2```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we say that a flight gets an additional point for refunds, and one more for luggage. Then, the scores are multiplied by their weights and summed up. The result is a score for the given flight on a 10-point scale. It can then be converted into a verbal description: outstanding, excellent, etc. Just like we have here, at HSE :) To customize this even more, we could at least ask the user for the weights. The scales could alse be customized, but for now let's just query the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this way any ticket can be categorized somehow and not be thrown into the 'other' category."
