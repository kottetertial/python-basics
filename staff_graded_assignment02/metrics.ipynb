    "The overall philosophy here is as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions calculating exact values of metrics validate only business constraints. For example, Total Measured Ad Impressions for CTR cannot be lower than Total Measured Clicks because it makes no sense. For the same reason these values cannot be negative. Additional similar checks are performed to avoid zero divisions. However, these functions assume that the input they get has the corrent type and do not perform type casting. Besides, the output is never rounded. The reason is that sometimes precision can matter. If rounding is required, it can be performed when printing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "User input is consumed and type-validated in the last section of the assignment. There, the program checks whether the input can be correctly parsed and casts it to the correct types to pass it to the target metric functions. In the user-interation section I cast all values that can be either integers or floats to floats because if a value can be parsed as an integer, it can surely be parsed as a float, but not vice versa (well, it technically can but the decimal part is going to be lost). But the metrics functions were still designed so that they accept both types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it might seem not too user-friendly to validate formatting and business constraints separately. For example, when a user has to enter multiple values and one of them is invalid, they might have to start all over again. However, I think that single responsibility is more important. Validation functions can only know how to statically validate the input, and metric functions can only know their logical constraints. That is, the user must be responsible for any inconsistencies in their data."

Click-through rates measure how successful an ad has been in capturing users' attention. The higher the click-through rate, the more successful the ad has been in generating interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Return on Investment (ROI)** is calculated as $$\\text{ROI} = \\frac{(\\text{Amount Gained} - \\text{Amount Spent})}{\\text{Amount Spent}} \\times 100$$ where \"amount gained\" is the amount of income that has been generated by an investment; \"amount spent\" is the total amount spent on an investment. ROI stands for Return on Investment and means the amount of money you get back relative to the amount of money you put into something. It is different to profit, which is simply the amount spent subtracted from the amount earned. ROI goes a step further and works out profit per the amount spent. This answers the question \"How much profit can I earn per pound/dollar/euro etc. spent?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average Page Time** is calculated as $$\\text{Average Page Time} = \\frac{\\sum{\\text{Time Spent on a Page by a User}}}{\\text{Number of Users}}$$ where \"time spent on a page by a user\" is time measured for each user who visits a webpage; \"number of users\" is the number of users who visit a webpage. Keep in mind, that usually users who spend less than 5 seconds on a webpage are not included in the calculations. Hint! You might think about parameters passed to a function as one of Python series structures.\n",
